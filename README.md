goGetJS extracts, searches, and saves JavaScript files. Includes an optional browser (playwright) for dealing with JavaScript-heavy sites.

## Overview
* goGetJS scrapes a given page for script tags, visits each src, and writes the contents to an individual file.
* All src are also saved to a text file.
* If a script tag doesn't include an src attribute, goGetJS scrapes everything between the script tags and writes the contents to an individual file.
* goGetJS (optionally) uses playwright to handle JavaScript-heavy sites and async scripts. Use -browser=true.
* Use -extraWait to grab those longer loading async scripts.
* Use -term, -regex, and -file, respectively, to scan each script for a specific term, a regular expression, or a list of terms.

## Additional Notes
* Possible flags: url, timeout, browser, extraWait, term, regex, file.
* By default, playwright waits until the network has been idle for at least 500ms before considering the page loaded. You can use the -extraWait flag (measured in seconds) for an additional wait period.
* When editing search.txt for your own use (or creating your own file), include just one term per line.
* goGetJS names JavaScript files with ```fName := regexp.MustCompile(`[\w-]+(\.js)?$`)```. Most scripts play nice, but those that don't are still saved.
